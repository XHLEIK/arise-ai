## 💭 Memory System Architecture

A.R.I.S.E. features a sophisticated two-layer memory system designed for persistent conversation context and fact retention.

### Architecture Overview

```
Memory System
├── Session Buffer (Short-term)
│   ├── Current conversation messages
│   ├── Real-time context building
│   └── Automatic saving on session end
└── Facts Storage (Long-term)
    ├── Persistent user information
    ├── Learned preferences and data
    └── Cross-session fact retrieval
```

### Memory Components

#### Session Buffer
- **Purpose**: Stores current conversation in memory for immediate context
- **Capacity**: Last 10 messages used for context building
- **Performance**: O(1) message addition, instant context retrieval
- **Persistence**: Auto-saves to `data/sessions/session_timestamp.json` on conversation end

#### Facts Storage
- **Purpose**: Long-term retention of important user information
- **Storage**: JSON file at `data/facts.json` with key-value pairs
- **Updates**: Automatic fact extraction from conversations
- **Examples**: User location, preferences, personal details, recurring topics

### Memory Integration Flow

1. **Message Addition**: Every user/AI interaction added to session buffer
2. **Context Building**: Recent messages + stored facts compiled for AI context
3. **Fact Extraction**: AI responses analyzed for new factual information
4. **Fact Storage**: New facts merged into long-term storage
5. **Session Persistence**: Complete conversations saved for future reference
6. **User-Initiated Deletion**: Voice commands can clear all session history

### User Memory Control

Users can manage their memory through voice commands:

| Command Examples | Action | What Gets Deleted |
|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| "Delete memory" | Clear all sessions | All session files + current buffer |
| "Clear memory" | Clear all sessions | All session files + current buffer |
| "Forget everything" | Clear all sessions | All session files + current buffer |
| "Remove all memory" | Clear all sessions | All session files + current buffer |

**Important**: Facts storage (`facts.json`) is preserved during memory deletion. This ensures user preferences and important information remain available even after clearing conversation history.

### Usage Examples

```python
# Initialize memory manager
memory = MemoryManager()

# Add conversation messages
memory.add_message('user', 'I live in New York')
memory.add_message('assistant', 'Got it! I will remember you live in New York.')

# Extract and store facts
facts = {'location': 'New York'}
memory.update_facts(facts)

# Build context for AI
context = memory.build_context()  # Returns formatted string with facts + recent messages

# Save session when conversation ends
session_id = memory.save_session()

# Delete all memory sessions (user request)
success = memory.delete_all_sessions()

# Get memory statistics
stats = memory.get_memory_stats()
# Returns: {'session_buffer_messages': 0, 'saved_sessions': 0, 'stored_facts': 2}
```

### Data Structure

#### Session File Format (`data/sessions/session_*.json`)
```json
{
    "session_id": "session_1694649600",
    "created_at": 1694649600.123,
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": "Hello", 
            "timestamp": 1694649600.123
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant", 
            "content": "Hi there!", 
            "timestamp": 1694649601.456
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Facts File Format (`data/facts.json`)
```json
{
    "location": "New York",
    "name": "John",
    "preferences": {
        "weather_units": "fahrenheit",
        "news_topics": ["technology", "science"]
    },
    "last_updated": 1694649600.123
}
```

### Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Time Complexity | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Add Message | O(1) | Append to session buffer |
| Build Context | O(n) | Format recent messages + facts (n ≤ 10) |
| Save Session | O(m) | Write m messages to JSON file |
| Load Facts | O(1) | Read JSON file into memory |
| Update Facts | O(f) | Merge f new facts with existing |
| Delete All Sessions | O(s) | Remove s session files + clear buffer |
| Get Memory Stats | O(s) | Count s session files + facts |

### Error Handling

- **File I/O Errors**: Graceful fallback to memory-only operation
- **JSON Corruption**: Auto-recreation of corrupted files
- **Disk Space**: Automatic cleanup of old session files (configurable)
- **Memory Limits**: Session buffer size limits prevent memory bloat

**🎯 The A.R.I.S.E. backend is production-ready and actively maintained.**

**Built with ❤️ by XHLEIK**

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3.10+**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the backend
python main.py

# Scan for applications only
python main.py --scan-apps

# List all found applications
python main.py --list-apps

# Launch a specific application
python main.py --run-app "Google Chrome"

# Enable debug logging
python main.py --debug
```

### Using the Application Scanner

```python
from modules.app_scanner import ApplicationScanner

# Create scanner
scanner = ApplicationScanner("data/applications.json")

# Scan for all applications
apps = scanner.run_scan()

# Get specific application path
chrome_path = scanner.get_application_path("Google Chrome")

# Launch application
import subprocess
subprocess.Popen([chrome_path])
```

## Configuration

The backend creates a default configuration file at `data/config.json`:

```json
{
    "system": {
        "auto_scan_applications": true,
        "log_level": "INFO",
        "data_directory": "data"
    },
    "applications": {
        "scan_on_startup": true,
        "scan_interval_hours": 24,
        "applications_file": "data/applications.json"
    },
    "ai": {
        "model": "gemini",
        "max_response_length": 500,
        "conversation_memory": true
    }
}
```

## Application Scanner Details

The application scanner finds software by:

1. **Popular Applications**: Checks known installation paths for common software
2. **Registry Scanning** (Windows): Reads Windows registry for installed programs
3. **Directory Scanning**: Searches common installation directories
4. **Executable Detection**: Identifies valid executable files

### Supported Applications

The scanner automatically detects:
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari
- **Communication**: WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram
- **Development**: VS Code, Notepad++, PyCharm
- **Media**: VLC, Spotify, iTunes
- **Productivity**: Microsoft Office, Adobe products
- **And many more...**

## Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
# Run application scanner test
python tests/test_app_scanner.py

# Or using pytest (recommended)
pip install pytest
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Logging

- Logs are saved to `data/arise.log`
- Console output shows real-time status
- Use `--debug` flag for detailed logging

## Platform Support

- ✅ **Windows**: Full support with registry scanning
- ✅ **macOS**: Application bundle detection
- ✅ **Linux**: Binary and package detection

## API Reference

### ApplicationScanner Class

```python
class ApplicationScanner:
    def __init__(self, output_file: str = "applications.json")
    def scan_all_applications(self) -> Dict[str, str]
    def save_to_json(self, applications: Dict[str, str] = None) -> None
    def load_from_json(self) -> Dict[str, str]
    def get_application_path(self, app_name: str) -> Optional[str]
    def run_scan(self) -> Dict[str, str]
```

### ARISEBackend Class

```python
class ARISEBackend:
    def __init__(self, config_file: str = "data/config.json")
    def start(self) -> None
    def stop(self) -> None
    def get_application_path(self, app_name: str) -> str
    def list_applications(self) -> Dict[str, str]
    def run_application(self, app_name: str) -> bool
```
