## 🔐 Voice Security System

### Advanced Speaker Verification

A.R.I.S.E. features a sophisticated voice recognition system powered by SpeechBrain's ECAPA-VOXCELEB model:

**🎯 Key Features:**
- **One-Time Enrollment**: 5-second voice sample creates your unique voice profile
- **Seamless Verification**: Uses the same audio from your command for identity verification
- **Multi-Method Validation**: Four different verification approaches for maximum accuracy
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Continues operation even if verification temporarily fails

**🧠 Verification Methods:**
1. **Both Thresholds**: Feature similarity + SpeechBrain score both pass
2. **Combined Score**: Weighted combination of both methods
3. **Feature Compensation**: High feature similarity compensates for low SpeechBrain score
4. **SpeechBrain Fallback**: Pure SpeechBrain verification as backup

**📊 Example Verification Scores:**
```
🔍 Voice verification scores:
   Feature similarity: 0.999 (threshold: 0.45)
   SpeechBrain score: 0.356 (threshold: 0.4)
   Combined score: 0.613 (threshold: 0.55)
🔍 Verification methods:
   Method 1 (Both thresholds): ❌
   Method 2 (Combined score): ✅
   Method 3 (Feature compensation): ✅
   Method 4 (SpeechBrain fallback): ❌
   Final result: ✅ VERIFIED
```

**🚀 No Double Input Required:**
Traditional systems ask you to speak twice - once for the command, once for verification. A.R.I.S.E. is smarter:
1. You speak: "What's the weather like?"
2. STT captures and stores the audio
3. System processes your command AND verifies your identity
4. Single input, dual purpose!

## 💭 Memory System Architecture

A.R.I.S.E. features a sophisticated two-layer memory system designed for persistent conversation context and fact retention.

### Architecture Overview

```
Memory System
├── Session Buffer (Short-term)
│   ├── Current conversation messages
│   ├── Real-time context building
│   └── Automatic saving on session end
└── Facts Storage (Long-term)
    ├── Persistent user information
    ├── Learned preferences and data
    └── Cross-session fact retrieval
```

### Memory Components

#### Session Buffer
- **Purpose**: Stores current conversation in memory for immediate context
- **Capacity**: Last 10 messages used for context building
- **Performance**: O(1) message addition, instant context retrieval
- **Persistence**: Auto-saves to `data/sessions/session_timestamp.json` on conversation end

#### Facts Storage
- **Purpose**: Long-term retention of important user information
- **Storage**: JSON file at `data/facts.json` with key-value pairs
- **Updates**: Automatic fact extraction from conversations
- **Examples**: User location, preferences, personal details, recurring topics

### User Memory Control

Users can manage their memory through voice commands:

| Command Examples | Action | What Gets Deleted |
|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| "Delete memory" | Clear all sessions | All session files + current buffer |
| "Clear memory" | Clear all sessions | All session files + current buffer |
| "Forget everything" | Clear all sessions | All session files + current buffer |
| "Remove all memory" | Clear all sessions | All session files + current buffer |

**Important**: Facts storage (`facts.json`) is preserved during memory deletion. This ensures user preferences and important information remain available even after clearing conversation history.

### Data Structure Examples

#### Session File Format (`data/sessions/session_*.json`)
```json
{
    "session_id": "session_1694649600",
    "created_at": 1694649600.123,
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": "Hello", 
            "timestamp": 1694649600.123
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant", 
            "content": "Hi there!", 
            "timestamp": 1694649601.456
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Facts File Format (`data/facts.json`)
```json
{
    "location": "New York",
    "name": "John",
    "preferences": {
        "weather_units": "fahrenheit",
        "news_topics": ["technology", "science"]
    },
    "last_updated": 1694649600.123
}
```
